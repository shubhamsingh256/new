            <p>On 6 October 2014 Flipkart launched a promotion called 'Big Billion Day' with the intention to increase the popularity of their website by targeting a billion sales in 1 day. This, even though Flipkart achieved the target, led to public outcry and widespread criticism among consumers, competitors and partners, heavily damaging its reputation. Many users could not place orders because of high server load and errors which led to frustration among customers.[91] Many users who placed orders received emails stating that their orders were cancelled.[92] Most of the products were sold for less than their cost, and Flipkart was accused of anti-competitive behavior. Major competitors filed complaints against Flipkart with the commerce ministry, claiming that selling products lower than cost is against the commerce policy of the country.[93] The Ministry said that they would formulate new trade rules for electronic retail after this incident.</p>
