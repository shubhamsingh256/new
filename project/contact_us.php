                    <p> The page explains thoroughly how responsive they are to questions: "We are incredibly responsive to your requests and value your questions." Then they actually list out what people will get when they ask a question, including a promise for a short response time of 12 hours or fewer. The page also includes easy-to-read contact information, social media buttons, links to offers, and even a list of recently published blog posts. Well done.</p>
